 * <p>Deletes a version of an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html">Lambda

 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { LambdaClient, DeleteLayerVersionCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-lambda"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { LambdaClient, DeleteLayerVersionCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-lambda"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new LambdaClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteLayerVersionCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteLayerVersionCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteLayerVersionCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link LambdaClientResolvedConfig | config} for LambdaClient's `config` shape.
