/**
 * <p>Deletes a Lambda function. To delete a specific function version, use the <code>Qualifier</code> parameter.
 *       Otherwise, all versions and aliases are deleted.</p>
 *
 *          <p>To delete Lambda event source mappings that invoke a function, use <a>DeleteEventSourceMapping</a>.
 *       For Amazon Web Services services and resources that invoke your function directly, delete the trigger in the service where you
 *       originally configured it.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { LambdaClient, DeleteFunctionCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-lambda"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { LambdaClient, DeleteFunctionCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-lambda"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new LambdaClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteFunctionCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteFunctionCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteFunctionCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link LambdaClientResolvedConfig | config} for LambdaClient's `config` shape.
